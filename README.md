# PM2.5 Concentration Analysis in Delhi using Time Series Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting **PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi** using historical air quality data from the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)**. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, time series modeling, and generating forecasts using **AR** and **SARIMA** models.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Extracted Data:** Daily **PM2.5** levels for **Delhi**
- **Original Dataset:** Comprehensive air quality data from multiple monitoring stations across India

## üõ† Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning
- Collected **PM2.5 data** for Delhi from the CPCB dataset
- Extracted **daily data** from a larger air quality dataset
- Handled **missing values** using **linear interpolation**
- Converted timestamps to **DateTime format** for time series analysis

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Time Series Analysis
- Conducted **stationarity checks** using **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test**
- Applied **differencing** and **seasonal differencing** to address **non-stationarity and seasonality**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development
- **Autoregressive (AR) Models**:
  - Experimented with multiple AR orders
  - **AR(3)** selected as the **best-performing model** using **AIC, BIC, RMSE, and MAE**
  
- **SARIMAX Models**:
  - Aggregated data to **monthly PM2.5 averages**
  - Tested various **seasonal configurations**
  - Identified **SARIMAX(1,1,1)(0,1,0,12)** as the **most efficient and interpretable model**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Validation & Forecasting
- Performed **residual analysis** to ensure **randomness and normality**
- Generated **forecasts** that accurately captured **seasonal and trend components**

## üìä Key Results

- **Best AR Model:** AR(3) on daily data
- **Best SARIMAX Model:** SARIMAX(1,1,1)(0,1,0,12) on monthly aggregated data
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, AIC, BIC
- Forecasts demonstrated the ability to **capture seasonal air pollution trends** in Delhi

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Incorporate **weather and temperature data** as exogenous variables to improve forecast accuracy
- Extend analysis to other pollutants like **NO2, SO2, and CO**
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for real-time air quality monitoring
